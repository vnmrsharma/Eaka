## Inspiration
In the present time while are are witnessing an era that have never seen before, we highly believe that now this digital world have the responsibility to help mankind though its extensions and innovative implementation.

With **Eaka**, we have tried to create a solution which is impacting the three most crucial agendas of todays world !
1. Education
2. Environment 
3. Mental-Health 

## What it does
**EAKA** an Integrated mental-health oriented educational platform to promote Learn by Doing and improve mental health as well as bost up the competitive spirit among students in order to plant and been involved in green sentiments to enrich environment. Also we have implemented an AI bot named **Buddy** that is designed to interact with any of the student feeling low, Buddy actually have the capabilities to interact in such an efficient way to the user that he/she will feel good, last but not the least buddy actually alarm the admin if it finds the interaction with user dangerous of identifies that that might be life threat.

## How we built it
*  The Mobile/iOS Platform is built with Swift and Firebase
* The AI BOT is been created with the help of Dialogflow training and been deployed over the Google cloud platform.
*  Google API integration in the bot.
Chatbot development using Dialogflow

## Challenges we ran into
- The biggest challenge was initially was **learning Swift** all the way from snatch, while been a part of SigmHacks and having no prior knowledge at first was a challenge but latter it turned into fun learning.
- **Different Time Zones** - As been located at IST, we have really worked all the night to get the work done at the right time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Created a workable prototype of a worthy and meaningful platform for not only the hackathon but for helping out the students.

## What we learned
*  Learned Swift as well as google Dialogflow integration with google cloud and API's.
*  Time Management is another thing. that we have learned throughout this hackathon.
## What's next for Eaka
*  For the next step we will be introducing a flutter based cross platform to continue EAKA.
*  Implementation of Human-Centric Sentimental analysis and integration with the application.
*  Creation for a robust module from the data interaction with the humans/ students.
